# React-Barba-Effect

[Barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) provides a smooth transition between the website's page but in the world of SPA, the designs made up of React/Vue have a challenging path to implement the same transition while routing internally. This project is to produce the same effect while transiting from one to another page in a SPA using react-router and the animation is produced using GSAP. 

## Installation

Make sure node.js is installed in the system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShyamBhuptani/React-Barba-Effect/
cd React-Barba-Effect/
npm install
npm run start
```


## Motivation
[Codegrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ergc889Jghc) has published a fantastic video to demonstrate barba.js which I framed into React producing the same effect and Barba.js isn't used yet the same effect has been reproduced.
